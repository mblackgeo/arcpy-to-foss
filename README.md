# ArcPy to FOSS
Conversion of ArcPy scripts to free and open-source software (FOSS).

The code in this repository is converted from [ESRI's ArcPy examples repository](https://github.com/arcpy/sample-gp-tools). No attempts have been made to convert the "toolbox" versions, only the scripts have been converted, however these could easily be converted to QGIS processing tools if needed; this may be tackled in the future.
